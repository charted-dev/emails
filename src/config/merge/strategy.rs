//! Common merge strategies for primitives. This is made since the default implementations
//! might not what you want, so this is some common ones that can be overwritten with the
//! `Merge` proc-macro, or written by hand without it.

/// Common merge strategies for strings. The default strategy will compare the strings
/// and checks if `lhs` != `rhs`. This comes with the `append` and `overwrite` strategies:
///
/// * `overwrite_empty` will overwrite `right` into `left` if `left` was empty.
/// * `overwrite` will overwrite `right` into `left` regardless
/// * `append` will append `right` into `left`.
///
/// For string slices (`&str`), it is impossible to do since string slices are immutable
/// while [`String`] is mutable, so we don't plan to add `&str` support without doing
/// unsafe code.
pub mod strings {
    /// Overwrites the left hand-side into the right-hand side if lhs was empty.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```no_run
    /// # use noelware_merge::strategy::strings::overwrite_empty;
    /// #
    /// let mut a = String::new();
    /// let b = String::from("overwritten!");
    ///
    /// overwrite_empty(&mut a, b);
    /// assert_eq!(a.as_str(), "overwritten!");
    /// ```

        if left.is_empty() {
            *left = right;
