//! This module is made for [`core-rs`](https://github.com/Noelware/core-rs) ~ Noelware's
//! core Rust crates that are used in every Noelware project and can be only accessed via
//! Noelware's Cargo registry.
//!
//! As the registry, repository, and crates are not available to the public yet, this is
//! copied from what Noel has wrote for it, so it is fine if we copy it.
//!
//! The code for the strategy module is only what `charted-emails` will use in its [`Merge`]
//! implementations.

pub mod strategy;

/// Trait that allows you to merge together two objects into one easily. This
/// is mainly used for the [`noelware-config`] crate to allow merges between
/// defaults, system environment variables, file-loading, and command-line arguments.
///
/// This can be used to your advantage to allow deep merging.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```ignore
/// # use noelware_merge::Merge;
/// #
/// pub struct MyWrapper(u64);
/// #
/// impl Merge for MyWrapper {
///     fn merge(&mut self, other: Self) {
///         *self.0 = other.0;
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [`noelware-config`]: https://crates.noelware.cloud/-/noelware-config/docs/latest

    /// Does the merging all-together by modifying `self` from `other`.
    fn merge(&mut self, other: Self);
